## 🔍 Why Google Says "Couldn't Fetch"

### This is NORMAL after first submission! Here's why:

1. **Caching Issue**
   - Google cached the old "failed" attempt
   - Takes 24-48 hours to try again
   - Your sitemap IS working now

2. **Crawl Budget**
   - Google limits how often it checks sitemaps
   - New submissions are queued
   - Not immediate

3. **Domain Trust**
   - Newer domains checked less frequently
   - minbod.netlify.app is established, so should be quick

4. **Timing**
   - Google crawls sitemaps on its own schedule
   - Can't force immediate re-check (mostly)

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. The "Style Information" Message is Normal
When you view XML in a browser, it shows that message.
It's just saying "this is raw XML without CSS styling."
**This is expected and correct!**

### 2. How Browsers Display XML
- Chrome: Shows raw XML tree
- Firefox: Shows formatted XML
- Safari: Shows raw XML
All are correct displays!

### 3. What Google Actually Sees
Google doesn't care about styling. It reads:
1. The XML structure ✅
2. The URLs ✅
3. The priorities ✅
4. The dates ✅

Your sitemap has all of these correctly!
