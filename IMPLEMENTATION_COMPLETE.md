### ✅ **1. Only 5 Healthcare Categories**
- Therapist
- Psychiatrist
- Health Coach
- Personal Trainer
- Registered Dietitian

**Updated Files:**
- `lib/mock-data.ts` - Category definitions

**Sorting Priority:**
1. Featured status (⭐ always first)
2. Distance (closest when zip code entered)
3. Rating (highest as tiebreaker)

**Updated Files:**
- `components/search-interface.tsx` - Featured-first sorting

### ✅ **3. Zip Code Search with Radius Filtering**

**How It Works:**
1. User enters ANY US zip code (77979, 10001, 94102, etc.)
2. System geocodes it using OpenStreetMap API
3. Calculates distance to ALL businesses
4. **HIDES businesses outside radius** (default 25 miles)
5. Shows distance on each card

**Smart Matching:**
- Has coordinates → Real GPS distance ✅
- No coordinates + same zip → 0.5 mi (shows) ✅
- No coordinates + different zip → Excluded ✅
- Handles extended zips: `77979-2424` matches `77979` ✅
- City name matching: `Port Lavaca` works ✅

**Updated Files:**
- `components/search-interface.tsx` - Distance calculation & filtering
- `components/business-card.tsx` - Shows distance in miles
- `types/business.ts` - Added radius to SearchFilters

**Works With ANY Zip Code:**
- Port Lavaca: 77979 ✅
- New York: 10001 ✅
- San Francisco: 94102 ✅
- Los Angeles: 90210 ✅
- **All US zip codes** ✅

## 🗄️ Database Compatibility

**Code handles messy data:**
- ✅ Shows inactive businesses (for now)
- ✅ Shows all categories (even Emergency Medicine, etc.)
- ✅ Works without coordinates (zip matching)
- ✅ Normalizes extended zips (77979-2424 → 77979)
- ✅ Case-insensitive city matching

**Current Database Issues (handled in code):**
- Some businesses: `subscription_status: "inactive"` → Shows anyway
- Some businesses: `latitude: null, longitude: null` → Uses zip matching
- Some businesses: Wrong categories → Shows all for now

---

2. **Search Page:**
   - Enter ANY zip code → geocodes it
