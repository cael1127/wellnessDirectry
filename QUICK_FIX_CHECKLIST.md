## 🐛 If Still Not Working

### Quick Diagnostics

**1. Check Sitemap Content**
```bash
curl https://minbod.netlify.app/sitemap.xml | head -20
```
Should show XML, not HTML or error message.

**2. Validate XML**
Visit: https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/validate-xml-sitemap.html
Enter: `https://minbod.netlify.app/sitemap.xml`
Should pass validation.

**3. Check Netlify Logs**
- Netlify Dashboard → Functions → Check logs
- Look for "Sitemap generated" message
- Check for any errors

**4. Verify Database Has Data**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT COUNT(*) as verified_count 
FROM businesses 
WHERE verified = true;
```
Should return at least 1 business.

## 🆘 Emergency Fallback

If dynamic sitemap fails, use static one:

```
[ ] In Google Search Console
[ ] Remove: sitemap.xml
[ ] Add: sitemap-static.xml
[ ] Submit
```

This will at least get your 5 main pages indexed while you debug.
