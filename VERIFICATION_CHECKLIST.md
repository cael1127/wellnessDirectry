### 3. **Zip Code Search with Radius** ✅
**Features:**
- ✅ Enter zip code in Location field
- ✅ Auto-geocodes to get lat/lng coordinates
- ✅ Calculates distance to all businesses
- ✅ HIDES businesses outside radius (no exceptions!)
- ✅ Shows distance in miles on each card
- ✅ Adjustable radius: 5-100 miles
- ✅ Featured businesses still filtered by radius

**How it works:**
1. User enters zip code (e.g., "77979")
2. System geocodes using OpenStreetMap API
3. Calculates distance to each business
4. Filters out businesses > radius
5. Shows only businesses within radius

**Special handling:**
- Businesses without coordinates but in same zip = 0.5 miles (shown)
- Businesses without coordinates in different zip = excluded

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `components/search-interface.tsx` - Distance calculation & filtering
- ✅ `components/business-card.tsx` - Shows distance
- ✅ `types/business.ts` - Added radius to SearchFilters

**How to verify:**
1. Go to search page
2. Enter zip code "77979"
3. Set radius to 10 miles
4. Should see ONLY Port Lavaca businesses
5. Try "94102" → Should see San Francisco businesses
6. Console shows: "Filtering out [Name]: X mi > 10 mi"

### 4. **Featured Businesses on Top** ✅
**Sorting Priority:**
1. **Featured** status (always first)
2. **Distance** (closest first, when location entered)
3. **Rating** (highest first, as tiebreaker)

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `components/search-interface.tsx` - Featured-first sorting
- ✅ `components/featured-businesses.tsx` - Query optimization
- ✅ Initial database query orders by featured DESC

**How it works:**
```javascript
// Sorting logic:
filtered.sort((a, b) => {
  // Featured always first
  if (a.featured !== b.featured) {
    return b.featured ? 1 : -1
  }
  // Then by distance (if location entered)
  if (searchLocation && a.distance !== b.distance) {
    return a.distance - b.distance
  }
  // Then by rating
  return (b.rating || 0) - (a.rating || 0)
})
```

**How to verify:**
1. Search any zip code
2. Featured businesses appear first (blue badge)
3. Then sorted by distance
4. Change radius → Featured still on top

### 5. **Authentication Required** ✅
**Protected Pages:**
- ✅ `/onboard` - List your business
- ✅ `/register` - Business registration
- ✅ `/dashboard` - Owner dashboard
- ✅ `/dashboard/business/[id]/edit` - Edit business

**Redirect Flow:**

## 🐛 Known Issues & Notes

### Issue: Businesses Without Coordinates
**Problem:** Some Port Lavaca businesses have `latitude: null, longitude: null`

**Solution:** Run this SQL to add coordinates:
```sql
UPDATE businesses 
SET latitude = 28.614889, longitude = -96.625778
WHERE zip_code = '77979' AND latitude IS NULL;
```

**Workaround:** System uses zip code matching for businesses without coords

### Issue: Inactive Businesses
**Problem:** Some Port Lavaca businesses marked as `inactive`

**Solution:** Run migration script to update categories, OR manually:
```sql
UPDATE businesses 
SET subscription_status = 'active'
WHERE zip_code = '77979';
```

## 📝 Migration Script

Use `migration-step-by-step.sql` to update existing database:
- Converts old categories to new 5 types
- Marks non-matching categories as inactive
- Preserves all data
